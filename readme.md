# TF2 Autoconfig
This project is designed to ease setting default configuration for Team Fortress 2 on Windows computers

It does this by downloading a file from pastebin to the appropriate directory.
The installation directory is found either by the location of a running TF2 process or by the default location.

## Usage
To use this, simply press `Win + r` and enter `mshta https://techchrism.github.io/tf2-autoconfig/index.html#CODE` where "`CODE`" is the pastebin code (not the full url)

Upon running, it will download the text file linked by the code to the `autoexec.cfg` file
